 <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">I receive far more requests to review papers than I can possibly handle. As a selection criterion, I prefer to accept reviews of papers in my areas of expertise, as well as from journals and conferences that do not seek to extract excessive financial profit from the work that authors and reviewers provide to the scientific community for free.</p>
